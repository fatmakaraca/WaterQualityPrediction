**Water Quality Prediction: Project Summary and Model Evaluation**

*Step 1: Data Collection*

This project uses a water quality dataset obtained from Kaggle. The goal is to classify whether water is drinkable based on various physical, chemical, and categorical properties. The dataset includes features like pH levels, concentrations of different chemical elements, as well as the color and odor of the water. These features play a significant role in determining the water quality.

*Step 2: Data Preprocessing and Cleaning*

The initial steps involved identifying and cleaning missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset. Proper data preprocessing was crucial for accurate model predictions. This included transforming numerical and categorical variables to appropriate formats, handling missing data (e.g., by filling them with the mean or using nearest neighbor methods), and removing outliers. Feature selection techniques were also applied to identify the most important features for the model.

*Step 3: Data Exploration and Analysis*

During this phase, various analyses were conducted to better understand the dataset:

Correlation Matrix: The relationships between features were visualized to understand linear dependencies. This helped identify which features had the most significant impact on water quality predictions.
Feature Frequency Distributions: The distribution of each feature was analyzed, providing insights into how the data is distributed.
Elbow Method: This method was used for clustering analysis, helping to determine the optimal number of clusters to describe the data.
Clustering: Features were grouped into clusters to facilitate further in-depth analysis.

*Step 4: Predictive Modelling*

In this step, different machine learning models were trained to predict water quality. The models used were:

Logistic Regression (LR): This basic classification model was chosen to learn linear relationships in the data.
Decision Tree Classifier (DTC): Aimed to capture non-linear relationships and provide more detailed analysis.
Random Forest Classifier (RFC): This ensemble model combines multiple decision trees to make more robust predictions.
These models were used to classify whether the water was drinkable or not.

*Step 5: Model Evaluation and Visualizations*

To evaluate the performance of the models, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used. Below is a comparison of the models:

Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Logistic Regression	0.81	0.83	0.81	0.82
Decision Tree	0.86	0.89	0.86	0.87
Random Forest	0.87	0.91	0.87	0.88

Logistic Regression: Served as the baseline model, providing quick results but struggled with complex patterns.

Decision Tree: Captured non-linear relationships well and improved performance.

Random Forest: Achieved the highest accuracy and provided the most stable predictions.

Visualizations, such as feature importance graphs, highlighted which features were most influential in predicting water quality.

*Conclusion*

This project utilized different machine learning models to predict the drinkability of water. After data preprocessing and analysis, the Random Forest model was selected as the best-performing model due to its high accuracy and stable performance. The project helped us understand the various factors influencing water quality and provided an effective approach for classifying drinkable water.
